======
After installing press ctrl+shift+p (Windows, Linux) or cmd+shift+p (OS X) and start typing scriptogram and hit enter

Package Installation
====================
If not using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can install it manually:

Bring up a command line in the Packages/ folder of your Sublime user folder, and execute the following:

<pre>mkdir Scriptogram 
cd Scriptogram 
git clone git://github.com/scttcper/Scriptogram.git
</pre>
When you launch Sublime Text 2, it will reload the packages in the packages folder.

Planned Features
================  
*Some sort of open save box with preformatted save file name(similar to website) and in correct dropbox location (not sure if last part is possible).
